SMFA is a process to yield oocysts of a parasite within a mosquito.  Well, several mosquitoes at a time.  The process involves prepping good, consistent controls.  Good, consistent controls are essentail to establsih before testing anyhting that might alter the number of oocysts.  Basically, we need to establish /know/reduce/standardize the noise of the processso that we can attempt to find the signal of a test.  In this SMFA, the background noise is the variation of oocysts produced across mosquitoes under control conditions, which means 0 units of dose of material to attempt to reduce the number of oocysts produce by parasite in the midgust of mosquitos.



You can also embed plots, for example:

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](readme_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2.png) 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
